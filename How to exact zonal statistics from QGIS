12/06/19
Software : QGIS
Dataset: Kelso shapefile and sentinel monthly data (multiple months)


STEPS

Open QGIS
Drag in the chosen shape file and all the satellite images you want to use.

Click "Processing" and then "Toolbox"
Select "Raster Analysis" and within there double click on "Zonal statistics"

A new box will open and in the bottom left corner click "Run as Batch Process" (this allows you to exact zonal statistics from multiple images in one go)

Click the box with "..." below "Raster layer" and select one of the satellite images.
Click the box with "..." below " Vector layer containing zones" and select the shape file of the area of interest
Add a reference text to the "Output column prefix" box e.g the month or date the image came from.
Click the box with "..." below "Statistics to calculate" and select the stats you want to exact.
To add another satellite image (same area different time point) click the green plus in the left hand top corner

Repeat the process above but replace the Raster layer with the next time point satellite image.

Continue this until you have added in all the satellite images you want to exact zonal statistics for.
Click "Run" 

Close the Batch Processing - Zonal statistics window
Right click the shape file and select "Open Attribute Table"

Scroll to the right of the table and see if the zonal statistics have been added, if not something has gone wrong so go back to the beginning.

If the data is there you can now exact the data as a csv file to do statistics on.
To do this right click the shape file and click export
Click "Save Features as..."
A new box will appear 
Change the format to CSV
Click the "..." to the right of the "file name" box and find a suitable location for your file, then choose a file name.
Leave all other boxes and click ok.

Open the folder you save the file to and check it's there.
