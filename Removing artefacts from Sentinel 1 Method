Removing artefacts from Sentinel 1 processed images

1. Download images from
http://gws-access.ceda.ac.uk/public/defra_eo/sentinel/1/processed/ard/backscatter/2018/

	Note- to speed up the process download multiple files and continue to download files whilst working on images to avoid waiting

2. Open QGIS and drag chosen file in

3. Check to see if there are any artifacts if not move file into checked folder

	Note- Organising folders into months maybe useful for additional processing 

4. Copy the image name and then create a new Layer.
	To do this Click the Layer header in the top banner of the program >
	New Shapefile >
	Click on the three dots at the left hand side of the File Name rectangle and create a new folder e.g. "risf"
	Paste the image name into the File Name box (you want the same file name as the original image file)
	Change the drop down menue selection for Geometry Type to Polygon
	Make sure the Additional dimensions drop down menue has selected EPSG:27700-OSGB 1936 / British National Grid
	Click Okay
